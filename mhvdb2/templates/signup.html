<p>MakeHackVoid depends on financial contributions from members to pay for the facilities it provides; and volunteer hours to keep the space maintained. Joining MakeHackVoid involves filling in the sign up form and agreeing to our community <a href="https://wiki.makehackvoid.com/policy:rules">rules &amp; guidelines</a>. For those who are able, we ask that you pay a monthly contribution to the running costs. Most people pay $30 a month using a scheduled payment through their online banking. There are also donation boxes in the space if regular payments are difficult for you.</p>

<p>MakeHackVoid also recognises &amp; highly values the non-fiscal contributions of our members through working bees; administrative tasks; and providing a clean, safe and welcoming environment for members and guests.</p>
