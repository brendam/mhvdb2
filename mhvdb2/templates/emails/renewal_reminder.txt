Hi {{name}},

Although our membership does not require payments, to be a member we ask that confirm your agreement to our code of conduct and rules (https://wiki.makehackvoid.com/policy:start) once each year.

You last indicated your agreement on {{agreement_date}} (or in some cases this date was set from the expiry of your previous membership). If you would like to renew your membership please visit https://members.makehackvoid.com/renew/ and enter the email address this email was sent to - {{email}}.

We rely on donations to cover the cost of running MHV, but these are voluntary and not required for membership.

Please visit https://makehackvoid.com/join/ for more information.

We hope to see you at MakeHackVoid again soon.

Thanks,
MaHaVo
