Hi {{name}},

At some time in the past you have been a member of MakeHackVoid. During 2014 we decided to make MHV membership more accessible and changed our membership to not require payments. To be a member under the new system you must agree to our code of conduct and rules (https://wiki.makehackvoid.com/policy:start) once each year.

We rely on donations to cover the cost of running MHV, but these are voluntary and not required for membership. Please visit https://makehackvoid.com/join/ for more information.

We are sending you this single email to see if you would like to rejoin the community.

If you would like to renew your membership please visit https://members.makehackvoid.com/renew/ and enter the email address this email was sent to - {{email}}.

We hope to welcome you back to MakeHackVoid!

Thanks,
MaHaVo
The MakeHackVoid Robot
